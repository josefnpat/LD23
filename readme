  Research Lab
  Attack Towers
  Wall && Door
  Like rebuild 2?

like netwars, towers attack local stuff automatically?

------------------------------------------------------

Somehow make this cute?

Oversized things
Tiny World - "It's a small world" expression?
Tower defense of some sort?
Adventure...
Space themed as in you come from a tiny world?
<vipah> this theme is just asking for 500+ platformers where things are "tiny"
No platformer for sure.
Alice in wonderland? -- w/ dinah the cat?
  You grow: thus the world is tiny?
  You shrink: you are tiny to the world?
Tiny = Dwarf Fortress Like?
Sim city-esqe?
Wraparound area where you are on the world doing stuff?
Slapstick.
You are a planet, and you need to "build it up" and take over the universe? Dune-esque?
pocket like pocket monsters?
pokemon meets final fantasy VIII
You pick one of X characters, and are have FF like stats?
You collect characters, like pokemon?
multiplayer?

Large world, randomly generated, but done in NES/DMG01 graphics?

isometric in 2bit color w/  8x8|16x16 graphics?

Character selection screen lets you choose players. 

http://donjon.bin.sh/world/ ?

Players need to build cities? 

Risk from Hasbro?



You get to place armies every turn depending on how many "countries" you have

easy - even pieces
medium - less pices
hard - almost none
